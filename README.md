# 🐚 Codecrafters Shell - Python

This project is part of the **Codecrafters Shell Challenge**, where the goal is to implement a mini UNIX shell from scratch using Python.

## 💡 What This Project Covers
- Building a CLI shell in Python
- Command parsing and tokenization
- Process creation and execution using `subprocess` and `os` modules
- Handling built-in commands like `cd`, `exit`, etc.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/RichaP23/RichaP23-codecrafters-shell-python cd RichaP23-codecrafters-shell-python
2. Run the shell:
python3 shell.py
